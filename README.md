# memory-src.game-java

This project aims to develop a memory src.game that challenges and improves our memory. We’ll use Java Swing and AWT libraries to provide the GUI components. As we progress through the project, we’ll be tasked with completing missing code snippets and gradually constructing different parts of the memory src.game.

At the beginning of the src.game, we’ll have a tiled grid showing the Educative logo as the default image icon. We’ll also have a turn counter to keep track of the number of turns. Clicking a tile will flip it and show an image icon. The objective is to find all the matching pairs. If two image icons flipped in a sequence are not the same, they will be flipped back, and the turn counter will be incremented by 1.

After finishing the src.game, we can reset and restart it using the “New Game” button, which will reshuffle all the image icons and reset the turn counter to 0. The src.game must be won within a maximum of 15 turns.
